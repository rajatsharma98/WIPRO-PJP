/*
Create a package called test package;
Define a class called foundation inside the test package; 
Inside the class, you need to define 4 integer variables; 
Var1 as private; 
Var2 as default; 
Var3 as protected; 
Var4 as public; 
Import this class and packages in another class. 
Try to access all 4 variables of the foundation class and see what variables are accessible and what are not accessible.
